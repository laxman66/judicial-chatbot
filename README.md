Introduction
The Judicial Chatbot is an AI-powered system designed to assist users with legal inquiries, judicial information, and court procedures. It provides general guidance on legal matters, explains legal terms, and offers help navigating legal processes. However, it does not offer specific legal advice or act as a substitute for professional legal counsel.
